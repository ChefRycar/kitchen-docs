##### Writing a Recipe

Here we go, time to automate our Git installation! Open `recipes/default.rb` in your editor of choice and write the following:

~~~ruby
package "git"

log "Well, that was too easy"
~~~

Hrm. That was a bit too easy. Let's put our code to the test right away!

<div class="sidebar--footer">
<a class="button primary-cta" href="/docs/getting-started/running-converge">Next - Running Kitchen Converge</a>
<a class="sidebar--footer--back" href="/docs/getting-started/configuration">Back to previous step</a>
</div>
