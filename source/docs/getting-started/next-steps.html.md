This concludes the getting started guide for Test Kitchen. Hopefully you are now more comfortable with Test Kitchen's basic usage, fundamental concepts, and a feel for a testing workflow.

From here, there are a few resources that can help you along your infrastructure testing journey:

* Jump in the `#test-kitchen` channel on [Chef Community Slack](http://community-slack.chef.io/)
* Check out the Test Kitchen [core code](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen) on GitHub
* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/issues)
* Write a blog post describing getting started with Test Kitchen, or an interesting problem Test Kitchen has allowed you to solve
* Take a look at the excellent O'Reilly book [Test-driven Infrastructure with Chef](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030973.do)

Everyone can contribute to making kitchen better, including the documentation. If you've learned something and want to contribute, please [fork the docs](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-docs) and open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)!
